## Train RNAIndel
Train the RNAIndel model using your training set.

### Step 1 (feature calculation)
Features are calculated for each indel and reported in a tab-delimited file.<br>
Suppose we have N samples. For i-th sample:
```
rnaindel CalculateFeatures  -i sample.i.bam \
                            -o sample.i.tab \
                            -r reference.fa \
                            -d ./data_dir_grch38\
                            [-v sample.i.external.vcf.gz]
```

### Step 2 (annotation)
The output tab-delimited file has \"truth\" column. Users annotate each indel by filling the column.
Possible values are:
```
somatic, germline, artifact 
```
<br>
Repeat Step 1 and 2 for N samples.
<br>

### Step 3 (update models)
Concatenate the annotated files.
```
head -1 sample.1.tab > training_set.tab           # keep the header line
```
```
tail -n +2 -q sample.*.tab > training_set.tab     # concatenate files without header
```
The concatenated file is used as a training set to update the models.
Specify the indel class to be trained by ```-c```. 
```
rnaindel Train -t training_set.tab -d ./data_dir_grch38 -c indel_class_to_train [other options]
```
